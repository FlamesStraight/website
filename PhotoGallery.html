	<p style="text-align:left;">During the progressions of years at One Tree Hill College, our school recently had made a massive change </br>
	when it came to our dietry needs. The school had made the choice to ban all unhealthy varieties of foods </br>
	that was being served within our school cafe, this was due to our school encouraging the OTHC community </br>
	to live in a healthy lifestyle, consuming nourishments that were beneficial to our human bodies, helping </br>
	us on a day to day basis. With the ban, the school had removed a selection of things like potato chips, </br>
	fizzy drinks and a variety of main course foods. Which then filled those empty spots with much healthier options. </br>
	</br>

	<h1 style="text-align:right;">The Start of the Healthy School Program</h1>
		
	<p style="text-align:right;">Then came to a new school system being created which had consisted of </br>
	providing free healthy school lunches throughout the entire day from morning tea to lunchtime, which goes on </br>
	everyday. By implementing this new system, it benefits all the staff and students to eat more healthy </br>
	nourishments, instead of eating very unhealthy consumables that will further on increase the chances of </br>
	very severe health conditions that can kill you. OTHC went ahead and teamed up with multiple food organisations </br>
	to provide us the ingriedients and recipes to make these healthy lunches for the entire OTHC Community, </br>
	as each day will be a different meal and will cycle onwards, and even having enough meals made which can </br>
	be served until the end of a school day.

	<h1 style="text-align:left;">OTHC's Contribution</h1>

	<p style="text-align:left;">After the implenmentation of the healthy school lunches program, OTHC's students had made </br>
	the effort to help with the program by making a school garden to harvest many different vegetables </br>
	that will be used in the making of these healthy school lunches, providing us more with healthy contents </br>
	within the foods being served, planting enough to be served for the entire OTHC Community during morning teas </br>
	and lunch times. Making a big contribution to help within the cause.
